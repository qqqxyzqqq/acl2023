# Datasets


 We use two standard benchmarks and two real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of FLMs and Ensembles. GoEmotions contains 58k carefully curated Reddit comments labeled for 27 emotion categories and neutral for the sentiment classification task. PRIMATE is a real-world dataset on mental health with posts coming from Reddit’s subreddit r/depression_help. PRIMATE stands for PRocess knowledge Integrated Mental heAlth daTasEt. PRIMATE aims to train conversational agents to identify parts of the user’s content that can answer a certain number of questions in clinical questionnaires like the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The dataset consists of ∼ 2500 posts annotated with nine “yes” or “no” labels corresponding to whether or not the post answers the nine PHQ-9 questions. SNLI corpus is the standard dataset for Natural Language Inferencing application, a collection of 570K labeled human-written English sentence pairs. Twitter dataset is tasked to train machine learning and deep learning models for sentiment detection on 1.6 Million tweets collected during COVID-19 Pandemic. Each row 
in the dataset is marked as 1 for positive and 0 for negative.
